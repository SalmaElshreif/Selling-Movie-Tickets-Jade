# Selling-Movie-Tickets-Jade


A selling movie tickets project using artificial intelligence and Jade is a program that can simulate the process of buying and selling movie tickets using agents. It uses artificial intelligence to model the behavior and communication of the agents. It uses Jade, which is a framework for developing multi-agent systems in Java. Here is an example of a project that implements this idea:

This project uses three types of agents: customer, seller and cinema. The customer agent can request a ticket for a movie, the seller agent can offer a ticket with a price, and the cinema agent can provide information about the movies and seats. The agents use FIPA protocols to communicate with each other. The project uses Eclipse IDE and Jade platform to run the program.
